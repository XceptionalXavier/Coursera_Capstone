# Evaluation-of-the-Optimal-Location-for-Erecting-a-Mexican-Restaurant-in-the-City-of-Madrid-Spain.
Battle of Neighbor, an IBM capston project on coursera for Data science.

In this project, the problem attempted to solve will be to find the best possible location or the most optimal, for
a Mexican restaurant in the city of Madrid, Spain. To achieve this task, an analytical approach will be used,
based on advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis, concretely clustering and perhaps some data
visualization techniques.
During the process of analysis, several data transformations will be performed, in order the find the best possible
data format for the machine learning model to ingest. Once the data is set up and prepared, a modeling process
will be carried out, and this statistical analysis will provide the best possible places to locate the Mexican
restaurant.

## Target Audience
The target audience of this project could be any business owner that is planning to open a new business local, restaurant, real state agency, shops, etc... Since this approach could be aplicable not only to mexican food restaurant but to other kind of businesses, anybody who is considering to place a new business local or even relocate it, could beneficiate of this project's approach.

• Cluster Two: Mostly inhabited by south Americans, Europeans, and North Americans. The most
