# Evaluation-of-the-Optimal-Location-for-Erecting-a-Mexican-Restaurant-in-the-City-of-Madrid-Spain.
Battle of Neighbor, an IBM capston project on coursera for Data science.

The goal addressed in this research was to determine the greatest potential site, or the most ideal location, for a Mexican restaurant in Madrid, Spain. To accomplish this goal, an analytical strategy was used, using sophisticated machine learning and data analysis tools, namely clustering and maybe some data visualization techniques.
Several data transformations were conducted throughout the analysis process in order to discover the best potential data format for the machine learning model to consume. Immediately after cleaning and preparing the data, a modeling procedure was conducted, and this statistical analysis identified the best feasible locations for the Mexican restaurant.

## Target Audience
This project's target audience might be any company owner considering opening a new local, restaurant, real estate agency, or retail location. Because this strategy is applicable not just to Mexican cuisine restaurants but to other types of enterprises, anybody contemplating establishing a new company or relocating an existing one might benefit from this project's approach.

## Results
Five clusters were identified, each with a significantly distinct population and venue distribution. The clusters are as follows:
1. Cluster One: The majority of residents are Bulgarian, and the most frequented establishment is a seafood restaurant.
2. Cluster Two: South Americans, Europeans, and North Americans make up the majority of the population. Among the most popular locations are tapas bars, Argentinean restaurants, pizza restaurants, supermarkets, and Spanish restaurants, to name a few.
3.  Cluster Three: This cluster is formed entirely of three distinct demographic types: Americans, Ukrainians, and Dominicans. The most often used locations are pizza restaurants, gyms, shopping malls, churches, and bakeries.
4. Cluster Four: This cluster is entirely made up of Bangladeshis. Spanish restaurants, falafel restaurants, seafood markets, fast food restaurants, and electrical shops are the most frequented establishments.
5. Cluster Five: Once again, this cluster seems to be populated entirely by Ecuadorians. Soccer grounds, burger joints, plazas, and fast food restaurants are the most frequently used places.
